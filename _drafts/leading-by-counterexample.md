Over the past decade, I have had the opportunity to work in a variety of different positions. The first of note was as a student employee of my univerity. I served as one of a fleet of mobile technicians that provided on-site IT support for other students. Though this was a great vehicle for socialization (and many relationships I maintain today were forged from work orders I fulfilled on the job), that proved to be the only aspect of the role that was all that engaging. So, when a summer internship was offered in which one could develop tools *for* the technicians in favor of *being* a technician, I naturally jumped at the chance. What followed was an incredibly formative experience.

On the job I worked one-on-one with a mentor who provided both guidance and respect for my autonomy on the projects I was assigned. Together we sketched designs on whiteboards, planned product roadmaps with other internal team members, and presented finalized projects to the team at large. As a development team of two, we built - and subsequently shipped - products quickly, receiving almost instantaneous feedback from other employees. This was not in the same realm as that of coursework. There was tangible, visceral, authentic value being emitted out by the work we put in. It set the standard by which I judged my experiences going forward.

Post-gradutation I transitioned into big tech, and from there into smaller companies ranging from start-ups to consulting firms. Throughout the years I wore a variety of hats: that of the developer, sysadmin, tech lead, salesman, incident commander, security consultant, etc. I likewise worked with a variety of people: engineers, product managers, sales, designers, legal teams, clients, etc. And now I currently reside in a transitionary period, one in which I'm actively taking a temporary step back from tech. I have been spending this period reflecting on the experiences that led me to where I am today, starting on the first day of my aforementioned internship.

To that end, this post represents my intention to formulate some retrospective on the teams I've so far participated in and worked with. As the title of this post suggests, my focus is on areas of improvement, not of success. The goal is to write a series of succinct summations of commonly recurring issues I've encountered from an organizational perspective across the board. To be clear, these "tenets" are abstractions, targeted at no one place or person in particular. As a further disclaimer, they should be taken with a grain of salt. They are tongue-in-cheek distillations of problems that are not generally easy to solve. Certain tenets will contradict others. Other tenets will clearly be far too small in scope to take too seriously, or too large for full remediation. Others still will be categorized more or less severely depending on the person, team, time, and place. Nonetheless, I hope this will serve as a reference for others, as an atlas of employment as I've so far come to experience it.

# Organization

As borrowed from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Si5njM3yHI, looking to also adapt https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Nuclear_Event_Scale as a rough idea on how I scale these problems, though within every categorization, problems are not necessarily ordered by severity.
