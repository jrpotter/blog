This post will be in stark contrast with the more technicals posts I've made in the past. Instead, I am looking to focus on my experiences working in the industry for the past decade. This will be a tongue-in-cheek description of the variety of problems I've encountered. Names and organizations I've worked with are redacted, but range from university, to big tech, to startups, to consulting firms.

As borrowed from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Si5njM3yHI, looking to also adapt https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Nuclear_Event_Scale as a rough idea on how I scale these problems, though within every categorization, problems are not necessarily ordered by severity.

As a caveat, many problems will likely contradict one another. I by no means believe a company can be problem-less. The goal though is to enumerate (non-exhaustively) the problems I have encountered thus far to serve as reference in the future.
