# Portfolio

This is my personal blog, powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and themed
with [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy).

## Quickstart

To run, first install [rvm](https://rvm.io/rvm/install) and confirm the
installation was successful:

```bash
> curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash
> type rvm | head -1
rvm is a function
```

Afterward, run the following sequence of commands:

```bash
> rvm install 3.2.2
> rvm use 3.2.2
> gem install bundler:2.4.22
> bundle install
```
