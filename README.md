This is my personal blog, powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with the
[Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) theme. To run, first
install [rvm](https://rvm.io/rvm/install) and confirm the installation was
successful:

```bash
> curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash
> type rvm | head -1
rvm is a function
```

Afterward, run the following:

```bash
> rvm install 3.2.2
> rvm use 3.2.2
> bundle install
> gem install jekyll
> jekyll serve --watch
```
