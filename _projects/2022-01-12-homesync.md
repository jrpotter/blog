Homesync provides a way of automatically syncing files across your desktop to a
<code>git</code> repository. By registering files with homesync, upstream and
downstream syncing can be done as requested, without any manual need to twiddle
files and copy them into a local git repository. Separately, a daemon service
exists that watches for changes as they happen.
