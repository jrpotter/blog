An experimental project for automatically syncing files across your desktop to a
`git` repository. By registering files with homesync, upstream and downstream
syncing can be done as requested, without any manual need to twiddle files and
copy them into a local `git` repository. Separately, a daemon service exists
that watches for changes as they happen.
