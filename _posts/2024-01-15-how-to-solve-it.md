Much of my focus over the past year or two has been oriented around learning how
to learn and systematizing how I go about thinking and solving problems. To this
end I've created thousands of [Anki flashcards](https://ankiweb.net/about),
tried various [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/) systems, and began
reading many books on the subject. The purpose of this post is to discuss one of
these books.

George P贸lya's *How to Solve It* is a very well-known text on how to
methodically approach a problem, where the word "problem" here is used in a very
general sense. I've transcribed the practice problems P贸lya lists at the end of
his book and try to solve them in two ways. The first listed solution will
recount my "default" approach. That is, my general thought process, where
I feel stuck, and how I go about working around any barriers I encounter,
without any intentional effort to use P贸lya's framework. The second approach
will instead use that framework to try and systematically break down the
problem.

To avoid influencing my "default" approach with P贸lya's method, I solve every
problem "my way" before starting back at [question 1](#question-1) with Polya's
approach in hand. After I solve a problem both ways, I then write a small
snippet describing my thoughts on the two approaches.

## Problems

### Question 1

A bear, starting from the point $P$, walked one mile due south. Then he changed
direction and walked one mile due east. Then he turned again to the left and
walked one mile due north, and arrived exactly at the point $P$ he started from.
What was the color of the bear?

{% accordion Default %}
After reading this question, my mind immediately goes to what possible colors
a bear can take on. I think "brown", "black", and "white". A distinguishing
feature of the different colored bears is geography, so, considering the
question discusses cardinal directions, this seems like the correct line of
thinking. For a bear to walk in these three directions and end up in the same
location means there must be a "bend" on the plane the bear is walking in. I
picture this:

Since this path would only be possible at Earth's poles, the bear must be white.

### Question 2

Bob wants a piece of land, exactly level, which has four boundary lines. Two
boundary lines run exactly north-south, the two others exactly east-west, and
each boundary line measures exactly $100$ feet. Can Bob buy such a piece of
land in the U.S.?

### Question 3

Bob as $10$ pockets and $44$ silver dollars. He wants to put his dollars into
his pockets so distributed that each pocket contains a different number of
dollars. Can do do so?

pages has the volume?

### Question 5

Among Grandfather's papers a bill was found:

$$72 \text{ turkeys } \$\_67.9\_$$

The first and last digit of the number that obviously represented the total
price of those fowls are replaced here by blanks, for they have faded and are
now illegible.

What are the two faded digits and what was the price of one turkey?

the given point that divides the given hexagon into two parts of equal area.

### Question 7

Given a square. Find the locus of the points from which the square is seen under
an angle (a) of $90^\circ$ (b) of $45^\circ$. (Let $P$ be a point outside the
square, but in the same plane. The smallest angle with vertex $P$ containing
the square is the "angle under which the square is seen" from $P$.) Sketch
clearly both loci and give a full description.

### Question 8

Call "axis" of a solid a straight line joining two ponits of the surface of the
solid and such that the solid, rotated about this line through an angle which is
greater than $0^\circ$ and less than $360^\circ$ coincides with itself.

Find the axes of a cube. Describe clearly the location of the axes, find the
angle of rotation associated with each. Assuming that the edge of the cube is of
unit length, compute the arithmetic mean of the lengths of the axes.

### Question 9

In a tetrahedron (which is not necessarily regular) two opposite edges have the
same length $a$ and they are perpendicular to each other. Moreover they are each
perpendicular to a line of length $b$ which joins their midpoints. Express the
volume of the tetrahedron in terms of $a$ and $b$, and prove your answer.

### Question 10

The vertex of a pyramid opposite the base is called the *apex*. (a) Let us call
a pyramid "isosceles" if its apex is at the same distance from all vertices of
the base. Adopting this definition, prove that the base of an isosceles pyramid
is *inscribed* in a circle the center of which is the foot the pyramid's
altitude.

(b) Now let us call a pyramid "isosceles" if its apex is at the same
(perpendicular) distance from all sides of the base. Adopting this definition
(different from the foregoing) prove that the base of an isosceles pyramid is
*circumscribed* about a circle the center of which is the foot of the pyramid's
altitude.

### Question 11

Find $x$, $y$, $u$, and $v$, satisfying the system of four equations

$$\begin{align*}
    x + 7y + 3v + 5u &= 16 \\
    8x + 4y + 6v + 2u &= -16 \\
    2x + 6y + 4v + 8u &= 16 \\
    5x + 3y + 7v + u &= -16 \\
\end{align*}$$

(This may look long and boring: look for a short cut.)

### Question 12

Bob, Peter, and Paul travel together. Peter and Paul are good hikers; each walk
$p$ miles per hour. Bob has a bad foot and drives a small car in which two
people can ride, but not three; the car covers $c$ miles per hour. The three
friends adopted the following scheme: They start together, Paul rides in the car
with Bob, Peter walks. After a while, Bob drops Paul, who walks on; Bob returns
to pick up Peter, and then Bob and Peter ride in the car till they overtake
Paul. At this point they change: Paul rides and Peter walks just as they started
and the whole procedure is repeated as often as necessary.

(a) How much progress (how many miles) does the company make per hour?

(b) Through which fraction of the travel time does the car carry just one man?

(c) Check the extreme cases $p = 0$ and $p = c$.

### Question 13

Three numbers are in arithmetic progression, three other numbers in geometric
progression. Adding the corresponding terms of these two progressions
successively, we obtain $$85, 76, \text{ and } 84$$ respectively, and, adding
all three terms of the arithmetic progression, we obtain $126$. Find the terms
of both progressions.

$$x^4 - (3m + 2)x^2 + m^2 = 0$$

### Question 16

From the peak of a mountain you see two points, $A$ and $B$, in the plain. The
lines of vision, directed to these points, include the angle $\gamma$. The
inclination of the first line of vision to a horizontal plane is $\alpha$, that
of the second line $\beta$. It is known that the points $A$ and $B$ are on the
same level and that thte distance between them is $c$.

Express the elevation $x$ of the peak above the common level of $A$ and $B$ in
terms of the angles $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$, and the distance $c$.

### Question 17

Observe that the value of

$$\frac{1}{2!} + \frac{2}{3!} + \frac{3}{4!} + \cdots + \frac{n}{(n + 1)!}$$

is $\frac{1}{2}$, $\frac{5}{6}$, $\frac{23}{24}$ for $n = 1, 2, 3$,
respectively, guess the general law (by observing more values if necessary) and
prove you guess.

### Question 18

Consider the table

$$\begin{align*}
1 & = 1 \\
3 + 5 & = 8 \\
7 + 9 + 11 & = 27 \\
13 + 15 + 17 + 19 & = 64 \\
21 + 23 + 25 + 27 + 29 &= 125
\end{align*}$$

Guess the general law suggested by these examples, express it in suitable
mathematical notation, and prove it.

### Question 19

The side of a regular hexagon is of length $n$ ($n$ is an integer). By
equidistance parallels to its sides the hexagon is divided into $T$ equilateral
triangles each of which has sides of length $1$. Let $V$ denote the number of
vertices appearing in this division, and $L$ the number of boundary lines of
length $1$. (A boundary line belongs to one or two triangles, a vertex to two or
more triangles.) When $n = 1$, which is the simplest case, $T = 6$, $V = 7$,
$L = 12$. Consider the general case and express $T$, $V$, and $L$ in terms of
$n$. (Guessing is good, proving is better.)

### Question 20

In how many ways can you change one dollar? (The "way of changing" is determined
if it is known how many coins of each kind - cents, nickels, dimes, quarters,
half dollars - are used.)
