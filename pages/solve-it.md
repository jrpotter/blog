## Problem 1

A bear, starting from the point $P$, walked one mile due south. Then he changed
direction and walked one mile due east. Then he turned again to the left and
walked one mile due north, and arrived exactly at the point $P$ he started from.
What was the color of the bear?

## Problem 2

Bob wants a piece of land, exactly level, which has four boundary lines. Two
boundary lines run exactly north-south, the two others exactly east-west, and
each boundary line measures exactly $100$ feet. Can Bob buy such a piece of
land in the U.S.?

## Problem 3

Bob as $10$ pockets and $44$ silver dollars. He wants to put his dollars into
his pockets so distributed that each pocket contains a different number of
dollars. Can do do so?

## Problem 5

Among Grandfather's papers a bill was found:

$$72 \text{ turkeys } \$\_67.9\_$$

The first and last digit of the number that obviously represented the total
price of those fowls are replaced here by blanks, for they have faded and are
now illegible.

What are the two faded digits and what was the price of one turkey?

## Problem 6

Given a regular hexagon and a point in its plane. Draw a straight line through
the given point that divides the given hexagon into two parts of equal area.

## Problem 7

Given a square. Find the locus of the points from which the square is seen under
an angle (a) of $90^\circ$ (b) of $45^\circ$. (Let $P$ be a point outside the
square, but in the same plane. The smallest angle with vertex $P$ containing
the square is the "angle under which the square is seen" from $P$.) Sketch
clearly both loci and give a full description.

## Problem 8

Call "axis" of a solid a straight line joining two ponits of the surface of the
solid and such that the solid, rotated about this line through an angle which is
greater than $0^\circ$ and less than $360^\circ$ coincides with itself.

Find the axes of a cube. Describe clearly the location of the axes, find the
angle of rotation associated with each. Assuming that the edge of the cube is of
unit length, compute the arithmetic mean of the lengths of the axes.

## Problem 9

In a tetrahedron (which is not necessarily regular) two opposite edges have the
same length $a$ and they are perpendicular to each other. Moreover they are each
perpendicular to a line of length $b$ which joins their midpoints. Express the
volume of the tetrahedron in terms of $a$ and $b$, and prove your answer.

## Problem 10

The vertex of a pyramid opposite the base is called the *apex*. (a) Let us call
a pyramid "isosceles" if its apex is at the same distance from all vertices of
the base. Adopting this definition, prove that the base of an isosceles pyramid
is *inscribed* in a circle the center of which is the foot the pyramid's
altitude.

(b) Now let us call a pyramid "isosceles" if its apex is at the same
(perpendicular) distance from all sides of the base. Adopting this definition
(different from the foregoing) prove that the base of an isosceles pyramid is
*circumscribed* about a circle the center of which is the foot of the pyramid's
altitude.
